# Operating System (OS)

## What is an Operating System?

For any system to function, it requires hardware components such as:

- CPU
- RAM
- Monitor
- Keyboard
- Hard Disk

These components alone do **not** make a system an operating system.  
An **Operating System (OS)** is the software that **runs on this hardware and manages it**.

### Definition

An Operating System is an **interface between the End User and the Hardware**.

There is no single universal definition of an OS, but commonly:

- It acts as an interface between **application software and hardware**
- It controls application programs running on the system
- It is a **resource allocator / resource manager** that allocates hardware resources to programs running on the OS (one at a time or via scheduling)

## What Lies Inside a CD/DVD ISO File?

An OS ISO file contains the core software required to install and run an operating system.

It is composed of **three main components**:

### 1. Kernel
- Core of the operating system
- Responsible for:
  - CPU management
  - I/O device management
  - Memory management
- Controls application software and system utilities

### 2. System Software
- Shell
- Command interpreters
- Core OS programs
- Provides system-level functionality

### 3. System Utilities
- Manage functions apart from the kernel
- Monitoring and analysis tools  
  - `ps`, `top`, `htop`
- Package management  
  - `apt`, `apt-get`

> The **Kernel** is the core OS. All system software and utilities operate under kernel control.

## OS Is Like a Big Elephant 🐘

Every aspect of the operating system is correct depending on perspective:

- **Hardware perspective** → Resource allocator
- **Software perspective** → Application controller
- **User perspective** → Interface for interaction

An OS has **multiple agents working simultaneously** in different areas.

## Functions of an Operating System

Operating systems can be studied from the following aspects:

### Core (Mandatory)

- Process Management
- CPU Scheduling
- Memory Management
- File & I/O Management
- Hardware Abstraction

### Optional (Common)

- User Interface
- Networking
- Security & Protection

## Process Management

### What is a Process?

> Any program loaded into memory is called a **Process**.

Examples:
- Running a command
- Executing a script
- Opening an application

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

IPC enables communication between processes.

#### Types of IPC:

- **Sockets**
  - Used for network communication
  - Client ↔ Server interaction
- **Pipes**
  - One process writes data, another reads it
- **Named Pipes (FIFO)**
  - Can communicate between different systems (different OS instances)

### Useful Commands

```bash
ps
ps -ef
top
htop
